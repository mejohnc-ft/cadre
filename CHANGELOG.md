# Changelog

What changed, for somebody deciding whether to upgrade. Written for the person running OpenBot, not
for the person who wrote the commit: a line belongs here when a deployment behaves differently
afterwards, and does not when only the code moved.

Newest first. `Unreleased` is what is on `main` and not yet tagged.

## Unreleased

## 0.1.0

### The product is Cadre

The fork grew its own product. Same deployment, same data; the name on the box is the change.

### Connections: sign in once, the coworker reuses the session

Connect is a named service tile, not a connection-CRUD maze. You sign in under supervision --
Microsoft via device code, so no screencast and no password passes through Cadre -- and the
captured session is what the agent reuses. Connect itself is idempotent now: stale control is
released before connect-begin, so the second click works like the first.

### Credentials live in a vault no coworker can read

Connection secrets go to the host keychain, not the agent's world. 1Password is a known
quantity: `op` runs on the host, the agent stays blind, and cadre-cred is an ask-and-approve --
the agent requests, you approve, the credential returns and is not retained. A public
placeholder key can no longer outrank a real keychain key.

### Provider keys never enter a computer

The egress boundary injects the provider credential on the way out, guarded by base-URL rules,
so a computer can reach its model and never hold the key that paid for it.

### Snapshots no longer echo secrets the server typed

A snapshot taken while a credential was being entered used to replay what was typed. It
doesn't.

### Runs that start themselves, on a stack that survives restarts

Triggers fire on their own and hand control over cleanly, and the stack now rides out reboots,
crashes, and lost volumes without losing its threads.

### The computer is a real desktop VM

The runtime is a desktop VM with Pi at the keyboard driving the browser through agent-browser,
not a browser extension pretending to be a desktop. Model routing, artifacts, and usage have
their own pages, and the live screen can be embedded elsewhere with a CORS webhook.

## 0.0.4

### A click citing a ref this deployment cannot resolve is refused

A Bot acts on a page by citing a ref from a snapshot, and the server turns that ref back into the
element before the boundary judges it. When the lookup failed, the action went ahead anyway with the
element half of the decision left empty — so a rule like "never click anything named submit" was not
declining to match, it was never shown the element, the shipped default permitted, and the click
landed on whatever that ref points at now.

The computer's own staleness check does not cover this. It compares a citation against its own
counter, so it catches the cases where the two disagree; the case that bites is the one where the
computer is content and only this deployment is out of step, which is what restarting a computer
under a stored snapshot leaves behind. The same click on the same button under the same policy was
refused before a redeploy and carried out after it.

A citation this server holds a snapshot for and cannot resolve is now refused, and the person is told
to take a fresh snapshot. Actions that name no element — scrolling, a page-level keypress, a shell
call, a file read — are untouched, and a computer this deployment holds no snapshot for still has its
citation forwarded, because there it is the only party that can answer. The refusal is raised after
the decision row is written, so an action somebody tried to take still appears on the trail.

**A deployment may see refusals it did not see before.** That is the point: those are the actions that
were being carried out without the boundary seeing what they touched. A Bot that meets one takes a
fresh snapshot and continues.

### A package ships its skills, so tool selection works on a clone

Tool selection narrows a Bot's tools to the ones its matching skills declare, and a deployment starts
with no skills at all. There was no `skills.yaml`, nothing seeded any, and nothing ever created one
— so on every fresh clone there was nothing to match against and the narrowing never switched on.
Left to a screen it would have stayed that way until somebody sat down and mapped tools to skills by
hand, in each deployment, again after each new connector.

A tenant package may now carry `skills.yaml`. Each skill has a slug, a title, a summary, its
instructions, and the `serverId/toolName` refs it needs. They are seeded on boot as deployment
skills, everybody sees them in the `/` menu, and connecting a connector is the only step left.

`skills.yaml` is optional, so every existing package loads unchanged and ships no skills. A package
may declare tools for a connector nobody has added: an unknown ref sits inert, because the offer is
still intersected with the Bot's grants. Naming a tool in a package grants nothing, exactly as
before.

A skill somebody wrote in the deployment keeps its name. If a package ships a slug a person already
took, theirs stands, the package loses that one, and the deployment starts — a name is not worth
refusing to boot over.

The example package ships four: `/find-a-document`, `/whats-changed`, `/who-owns-this` and
`/check-a-claim`.

### The tools a skill needs can be picked where the skill is written

A package's skills arrive with their tools declared. A skill somebody writes here could not: the
`tools` field existed on the save endpoint and on no screen, so a skill written in the product declared
nothing, and the only way to change that was to call the API by hand. Writing or editing a skill now
lists the tools of every connected server, grouped by server, with the ones that change something
marked.

Picking a tool here is not granting it. The offer is still intersected with what the Bot was granted,
so a skill naming a tool its Bot does not hold selects the skill and loads nothing — which is why
anybody may write a skill while connecting a server stays an administrator's decision. The screen says
so, next to the choice.

A tool the skill names that no connected server offers is shown too, under its own heading, rather
than left out. A package ships skills declaring tools for connectors nobody has added yet, and a
skill outlives the server it was written against, so a screen that drew only what matched was
stating part of the declaration as though it were all of it.

## 0.0.3

### A Bot is offered the tools its message needs, not every tool it holds

A model chooses the right tool reliably out of about ten and unreliably out of thirty, and it fails
quietly: it calls a plausible neighbour, or calls nothing and answers from what it already knew. Two
connectors is enough to cross that line, so a Bot holding more than twelve tools is now offered, for
each run, the tools of the skills that match the message.

Skills already declare the tools they need. That declaration is now what the offer is built from:
the deployment asks its own model which skills a message needs, and the Bot gets those skills' tools
plus every granted tool no skill has claimed. Nothing here can widen a Bot: the offer is intersected
with the grants, so naming a tool in a skill still grants nobody anything.

Nothing changes for a deployment that has not declared tools on any skill, or whose Bots hold twelve
tools or fewer. Those Bots are built exactly as before, with no extra model call.

There is a new audit event, `mcp.tools_discovered`, written before the run. It says how many tools
were offered out of how many granted, and why: the skills chosen, or that nothing was declared, or
that the choice could not be made. It answers "why did it call that", and the harder question, "why
did it not call anything at all" — which until now left no trace.

### The intent router works again behind a gateway

`OPENAI_BASE_URL` is documented ending in `/v1`, and the router appended `/v1/chat/completions` to
it, so every call went to `/v1/v1/chat/completions` and 404'd. The router reads a failure as "not
sure" and falls back to the default coworker, so on any deployment that set the variable — a
gateway, a proxy, a self-hosted model, which is the only reason to set it — untagged messages
silently stopped being routed and nothing said why. The version segment is now added only when the
configured URL does not already carry one.

## 0.0.2

### Upgrading

`AGENT_TOOL_TOKEN` is generated for you on a laptop. `scripts/start.sh` mints one and writes it to
`.env`, the way it already did for `MANAGED_AGENT_TOKEN`. Without it no Bot could call a tool back
through the deployment, which is the correct default for a deployment and made every MCP tool dead
on arrival on a fresh clone. A value already set is kept, and `.env.example` still ships it empty,
so a deployment not using `start.sh` is unchanged and still fails closed.

`start.sh` also stops skipping work for services that are already answering. A Bot container is now
handed to `docker compose` on every run and the server is restarted when this run minted a secret,
because answering says a process is alive and not that it still agrees with the deployment. The cost
is that a run which rebuilds an image recreates the Bot containers, about five seconds; `supervisor`
already behaved this way.

Two configurations now refuse to start:

- A provider configured with no `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS`. Set it to at least one address.
- No provider at all and no `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true`. Configure a provider, or set that to say you
  meant a deployment where every visitor is one administrator. This no longer depends on `NODE_ENV`,
  which is unset by default and so let exactly the dangerous case through. A deployment already
  running open needs the line added before it will start again.

Registering an OpenID Connect provider needs every host in its discovery document in
`TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, not only the issuer. Better Auth 1.7 checks each endpoint it finds, so a Google
issuer also needs `oauth2.googleapis.com` and `openidconnect.googleapis.com`. Registration is
refused with the untrusted host named.

A Bot id may now contain only letters, digits, hyphen and underscore, and must start with a letter or
digit. The same rule container and volume names have always followed. A deployment whose
`COMPUTER_BOT_ID` breaks it refuses to start and says so, rather than answering 400 to everything.

`AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` is new and unset, which keeps the audit trail forever, as before. Set it to a
whole number of days to have old rows removed.

The local document index and the old connector tables are dropped by migration. `documents`,
`chunks`, `document_acls` and the four connector-bookkeeping tables are removed and their rows go
with them; this cannot be rolled back. A deployment that had been syncing into the local index loses
that copy, which is the point: answering now goes through a live system's own search.

**An MCP server pointed at a credential that no longer exists loses the pointer.** `mcp_servers`
now names its credential with a real foreign key, where the column was `text` against a `uuid`
primary key with nothing checking it — so a deployment is allowed to be holding a pointer to a vault
row that was deleted underneath it, and the screens read as though the server were still configured.
The migration clears those before adding the key, because it cannot add it otherwise. If this
happens, that connector correctly reports having no credential and an administrator registers it
again; nothing else is affected, and a deployment with no such pointer sees nothing.

**The old Google Drive connector is gone, and it is not the new one renamed.** It configured a
service account with domain impersonation and had the worker sync documents into a local pgvector
index guarded by our own ACL rows, so every person got the same answer computed from what one
credential could see, and revoking somebody's access left a cached copy of their documents behind.
`/admin/connectors` and its two screens, the connector catalogue and admin service, the sync
persistence and the worker's connector runner have all been removed. A deployment that was syncing
this way stops syncing and should enable the new connector at `/admin/plugins/google-drive`, where
each person connects their own account.

`knowledge.yaml` is still parsed and still refused when malformed, because it is part of the
deployment-package contract. Its `sources:` are now read by nothing.
`MANAGED_AGENT_AG_UI_URL` is no longer required to start. The one-container image does not carry a
Bot, so requiring it registered the shipped Risk Analyst against a host that was not there and every
conversation with it failed. Leave it unset for that image. A laptop `scripts/start.sh` still points
it at `agent-langgraph`. A URL with no `MANAGED_AGENT_TOKEN` still refuses to start; a leftover
token with no URL is ignored.

A `.env` copied from an older `.env.example` still has `MANAGED_AGENT_AG_UI_URL=http://localhost:4201/ag-ui`.
Unset it before `docker run --env-file .env`, or the coworker comes back.
The built-in Bot refuses to start without `OPENAI_API_KEY`. It used to start, report healthy, and
then fail every conversation, so a missing key looked like a working deployment. The LangGraph Bot
already refused the same way.

Sessions survive and nobody signs in again.

### Changed

- **This deployment does not search documents itself.** A Bot answers from a live system by calling
  that system's own search as the person asking, so the vendor decides what they may see and there is
  no second copy of anybody's documents here to keep in step, to secure, or to leave behind when
  somebody is removed. The local index that was being filled — `documents`, `chunks` and
  `document_acls` — and the connector that filled it have both been dropped. Retrieval over
  a copy of a customer's corpus is not a thing OpenBot does.

### Added
- **A skill can say which tools it needs.** `POST /api/plugins/skills` takes a `tools` list of
  `serverId/toolName` references, stored against the skill and returned with it. This is the unit
  tool retrieval will select over: a model picks a skill from its summary, and the skill says
  what to load. **It grants nothing.** A skill naming a tool a Bot was never granted still cannot
  call it, which is what keeps writing a skill open to anybody rather than to administrators
  only. A reference naming no tool this deployment has seen is refused when the skill is saved,
  so a typo is an error where it was written. Leaving the field out of a save leaves whatever was
  declared before, so nothing that predates it clears a declaration; sending an empty list is how
  a skill stops asking. Nothing consumes these yet — selection is the next piece, and until it
  lands a deployment behaves exactly as before.
- **A message with no `@` goes to the coworker it is for.** Typing without naming anyone used to
  reach the default coworker; to get a specialist you had to `@` them. Now an untagged message is
  routed to the coworker whose purpose matches it, chosen against each coworker's own description by
  the deployment's own model, before the channel is pinned. It is named, not silent: the channel
  header is the coworker it went to, and a `channel.routed` row records the choice, the reason, and
  the candidates it chose between (never the message itself). `@` still wins as an explicit override
  and skips routing entirely. If the router is uncertain or unreachable, it falls back to the same
  default the composer always used, and says so, rather than misroute or drop.

- **A Bot can answer from Google Drive, as the person asking.** Ask a Bot a question whose answer is
  in a document and it answers from the live file rather than from an index, citing a link that opens
  it. A Bot granted these tools reads Drive on the asker's own grant, so two people asking the same
  question get the answers their own accounts can see, and neither sees the other's documents.
  Read-only: the scope requested is `drive.readonly`, so a write is refused by Google before this
  deployment has to. Nothing is cached — the refresh token is stored and an access token is minted
  per call, so revoking access at Google takes effect on the next one rather than when a cache
  expires.

  Setting it up takes two people and neither can do the other's half. An administrator registers a
  Google Cloud OAuth client and enables the connector at `/admin/plugins/google-drive`; each person
  then connects their own account, and there is deliberately no endpoint for an administrator to
  connect one on somebody's behalf. The redirect URI has to match what is registered character for
  character, and the connector page states the exact string to paste, because a mismatch fails at
  Google with a message that never mentions OpenBot. See
  [docs/plugins/google-drive.md](docs/plugins/google-drive.md) for the whole setup and for what each
  failure means.

  **Disconnecting is not built yet.** The account page says so and points at Google's own third-party
  access settings, which is what withdraws it today.
- **Each tool a connector offers has its own screen**, at `/admin/plugins/<connector>/tools/<tool>`,
  with a switch per Bot. The connector page previously drew a button per Bot inside every tool row,
  which is a control per Bot per tool stacked in one list, and grew without bound as Bots were added.
- **Connected accounts**, at `/settings/connected-accounts`. What a Bot may read as you, and the
  scope the vendor actually granted rather than the one that was asked for.
- **A tool result that found nothing says so.** An empty result used to reach the model as an empty
  string, which reads as "the tool had nothing to say" rather than "there is nothing there" — and a
  model closes that gap from memory, which for a knowledge connector is the failure worth preventing.
- **The shipped Knowledge Bot answers from the tools it has.** Its instructions in
  `examples/fintech` told it to say no source was connected, which was honest when none could be:
  the connector this replaces had been removed and nothing had taken its place. With a connector
  granted it became the opposite of honest — the Bot called a tool, was handed a file listing, and
  said it had no access anyway. It now reports what its tools return, says so plainly when it has no
  tool or a tool reports a problem, and does neither of the two things worth forbidding: answering
  from its own memory as though it came from a source, or claiming to lack access to something a tool
  has just returned. A deployment with its own tenant package is unaffected.
- **`mcp.call_failed`.** A call this deployment permitted and the vendor did not complete now leaves
  a row of its own, carrying the vendor's own sentence. `mcp.call_succeeded` was written before the
  network call rather than after, so a call that died at the vendor recorded success and the Admin
  page agreed with it.
- **Releases are cut by a workflow, not by hand.** `Create release PR` bumps the version and promotes
  `## Unreleased` to a numbered section; merging the pull request it opens is what publishes. Merging
  builds and pushes one image to `ghcr.io/copilotkit/openbot`, signs a build provenance attestation
  for its digest, tags the commit and creates the GitHub Release with `container-images.json` so a
  deployment can name an exact digest rather than a tag somebody could move. See
  [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).
- **CI now runs the thing it ships.** Two checks were added. `migrations` refuses a schema change
  with no migration written for it, and a snapshot that has drifted from the schema. `image` builds
  the container, boots it with embedded PostgreSQL, and fails if it does not answer or if a
  supervised service is respawning. A single `verify` check covers every job, so branch protection
  needs one entry. The same checks run again against the release commit when a release is published,
  so they gate the release rather than the proposal for one.
- **Sign in with Google, Microsoft or Okta.** Any one of them turns sign-in on; configure several
  and the sign-in screen offers each, on matching buttons carrying each provider's own mark.
  `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` says who is an administrator. It is required whenever a provider is
  configured, because nothing else grants the role, and it is now a floor rather than a one-off:
  an address it names is made an administrator at every sign-in, so adding somebody to the list
  works even after they have already signed in.
- **SAML and OpenID Connect, registered while running.** `/admin/identity-providers` takes the
  metadata a company's identity team supplies and registers their own IdP. Somebody then types their
  email address on the sign-in screen and the domain decides which provider they are sent to, so a
  company mid-merger can run two. Registering, changing or removing one is administrator-only, which
  the upstream plugin does not require: it guards those routes with a session, and anybody who could
  reach them could register a provider for a domain and mint themselves colleagues.
- **A People screen.** `/admin/people` lists everybody who has signed in, with the provider they came
  through and when they were last here, and lets an administrator promote, demote, or remove
  somebody. Removing ends the session they are using and stops the next sign-in, keyed on the
  address so signing in again through the provider does not quietly create a new account. Every
  change is on the audit trail. Somebody named in `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` cannot be demoted or
  removed here, and nobody can do either to themselves.
- **One container that runs the whole thing.** The root `Dockerfile` builds an image carrying the
  app, the API, a Bot computer, and optionally PostgreSQL, supervised together. Point `DATABASE_URL`
  at a database you already run and the built-in one never starts; leave it unset and the container
  is self-contained. See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the measured minimum sizes and
  the platforms it has been run on.
- **Bots can run commands.** `computer_run_command` runs a command in the Bot's `/workspace`, so a
  Bot can install a tool, unpack what it downloaded, or run what it was asked to run instead of only
  driving a browser. Governed like every other action: the policy decides, the audit row is written
  first, and a rule can refuse a shell outright with `intent == "run_command"` or refuse particular
  commands. The command is recorded; its output is not.
- **The audit trail shows the command.** A command row names what ran, the way a file row names the
  path, rather than reporting an element it was never about.
- **`COMPUTER_SANDBOX=on`** turns on Chromium's own sandbox where the host permits user namespaces.
  Which way it went is printed at start-up either way.
- **New chat.** The direct Bot chat has a button that starts a fresh conversation, which it had no way
  to do before: the thread was minted once and remembered for that Bot forever, so the only way out
  of a conversation was to clear the browser's storage by hand.
- **You can watch what a Bot is doing, not only what it is looking at.** The screen answered half the
  question: a Bot spending two minutes in a terminal showed a blank browser and one grey line per
  command, with the output nowhere. A command line in the transcript now opens to show what it
  printed, its exit code, and whether it was cut short or stopped. Beside the screen there is an
  Activity tab carrying every command, file read, file write and listing as they happen, newest
  first, with a count on the tab so a Bot working away from the browser is visible without switching
  to it. A saved file shows its path and size, never its contents. This is a live view of the open
  conversation; the record is still the audit trail.
- **Sign-in is on the audit trail.** Rows for signing in, for being refused, and for the configured
  administrator list granting somebody the role. Two questions had no answer before: who granted
  themselves administrator by editing `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS`, and whether somebody just removed had
  ever been here, since removing them deletes the sessions that were the only evidence. A trail that
  is unavailable never blocks a sign-in.

### Fixed
- **A ref could resolve against a page from a computer that no longer existed.** The generation a
  computer stamps on a snapshot is unique only within one run of it, so a replaced container counts
  from one again and a ref the model is still holding matches a row nothing has overwritten. The
  policy then decides on an element from a dead page, and the audit row names it. Wiping a computer
  cleared the row for that reason and was the only thing that did; replacing one whose image changed
  did not, and the server was never told. A snapshot now carries which run of the computer took it,
  refs from an earlier run resolve to nothing, and the first snapshot of a new run replaces the old
  row however low its generation.
- **A migration stamped in the future silently swallowed the next one.** Drizzle runs a migration only
  when its journal timestamp is later than the newest one the database has recorded, so a migration
  stamped ahead of real time raises that ceiling and every migration written after it is skipped
  until the clock catches up. `drizzle-kit migrate` reports success the whole time. One migration was
  hand-written a day into the future and did exactly that to the next one to arrive: the table was
  never created, and the only sign was an integration test failing on a relation that did not exist.
  The timestamps are corrected, an older inversion between two earlier migrations is corrected with
  them, and the journal is now checked by a test, because nothing else in the build would notice.
  **If you ran a build between these, your database has the wrong ceiling recorded and will skip the
  next migration.** Repair it with
  `update drizzle.__drizzle_migrations set created_at = 1787359000000 where created_at = 1787444747113;`
  or start from a fresh database, where migrations all run in one pass and ordering cannot bite.
- **Every Bot ran a model two generations old, and it was costing tool calls.** The example package
  shipped `gpt-4.1` as the default for every built-in Bot. Asked to open a page behind a sign-in,
  those Bots answered "would you like me to prompt you to sign in?" and called nothing, three times
  out of three, while the prompt forbids that sentence in as many words. On `gpt-5.6-terra` the same
  question produces the tool call first try, so the package now runs `gpt-5.6-terra`. It is a
  default, not a commitment: `model.yaml` still decides.

  The Bots that answer over AG-UI stay on `gpt-5.5`, each for its own measured reason. The framework
  Bot answers nothing at all on `gpt-5.6-*` through the Responses API — `RUN_STARTED`, then
  `RUN_FINISHED`, no text — and the hand-written one cannot use function tools on
  `/v1/chat/completions` with a 5.6 model unless reasoning is turned off, which is the wrong trade
  for a Bot whose job includes deciding when to ask a person for help. It refuses to start on such a
  model now rather than failing one silent tool call at a time. Where a 5.6 model is set deliberately,
  the Responses API is switched on for it automatically, because a deployment that set the model and
  did not know about that switch got a Bot which started, looked healthy, and failed on its first
  tool call.
- **A Bot browsed to a vendor this deployment already connects to.** A Bot holding no grants was told
  nothing about connectors at all, so it treated a connected vendor as an ordinary website: asked
  about Google Drive it opened `drive.google.com`, met a sign-in page, and asked the person to sign
  in to an account the deployment had already connected. Every Bot is now told which vendors exist
  here, held or not, and says plainly which one it has not been granted rather than reaching for the
  browser.
- **A conversation was destroyed by a declined take-the-wheel.** A Bot that asks for help with a
  sign-in and never gets it left a tool call nothing ever answered, and every later turn in that
  thread failed at the provider. This was fixed once for the framework Bot and not for the Bot in the
  box, which is the one behind the Browser Bot, so it went on happening where most people would meet
  it. Both now answer their own unanswered calls with the truth rather than a fake success.
- **A Bot refused because a person had the wheel was told its refs were stale.** The computer flags a
  takeover, the surface branches on that flag, and the flag did not survive the server, so a Bot was
  sent back round the same action against the person who had just taken the browser. Reported and
  fixed by @beardthelion.
- **A person could not take the wheel unless the Bot offered it.** The button appeared only after a
  Bot called for help, so the control a person needs depended on the Bot getting one instruction
  right, and when it did not there was nothing to press. It is there whenever the Bot is driving now.
  The Bot asking for help is still its own row, with its reason.
- **The first message of a new channel could be lost.** A new channel's thread does not exist until
  its first run, so the join that restores history had nothing to settle against; the message was sent
  anyway after a deadline, while that join was still in flight, and the join finishing replaced it
  with the thread's messages, which were none. The deadline now ends the join and waits for it, so
  nothing is left in flight to overwrite anything. The transcript also says it is loading rather than
  showing an empty conversation, and the thinking line is visible for the first time: a CSS rule
  blanked the colour a gradient was built from, so the glyphs were painted with nothing. Reported and
  fixed by @zopeVaibhav.
- **The in-memory snapshot store disagreed with the table.** The database only ever moves a snapshot
  forward; the in-memory one, which is what a test reaches for when it has no database, took whatever
  arrived last. A test could therefore prove a boundary property that is false in a deployment.
  Reported by @beardthelion, fixed by @NathanTarbert.
- **A computer that had opened nothing still reserved a browser-sized frame.** That put a placeholder
  the height of a browser window into the middle of a conversation, above an answer that never
  involved the browser.
- **A Bot named after a deployment route was served without its guard.** The computer router steps
  aside for `/policy` and `/fleet`, which are its own paths and not about a Bot, because Hono matches
  `/*` against zero segments and a single-segment path arrives as a Bot id. It stepped aside on the
  name alone, so it covered everything under those names too: `/policy/status` is `/:botId/status`
  with a Bot called `policy`, and for that whole subtree the access check was never called at all.
  The guard now steps aside only for the deployment path itself, and a Bot may no longer be named
  after one: a package declaring it is refused, and a deployment that already holds such a Bot
  refuses to start and names it rather than serving it. Reported and fixed by @beardthelion.
- **Upgrading never reached a Bot's computer.** A computer is a container the supervisor makes, and it
  was reused by name whatever image it was built from, so once a Bot had one, rebuilding the image
  moved the tag and the container went on running the old one indefinitely with nothing to say so.
  `docker compose down` does not touch these either, because compose did not make them, so even a
  full teardown left them behind. That is worse than stale code: the computer is the browser, the
  workspace and the confinement around both, so a fix to any of them silently did not apply. A
  computer built from a different image is now replaced on next use. Its profile and its workspace
  are volumes and are kept, so a Bot comes back on the new image still signed in to what it was
  signed in to, with its files where it left them.
- **The audit trail could be erased with one statement.** It is append-only because a database
  trigger refuses updates and deletes, and that trigger is row-level, so `TRUNCATE` never reached it:
  anything holding `DATABASE_URL` could empty the table and nothing raised. That is the case the
  guarantee exists for, since it is enforced in the database precisely because the application is not
  the only thing that reaches the table. A statement-level trigger now refuses a truncate, and it
  answers before the retention setting is read, so declaring a retention window no longer permits one
  either. Retention itself is unchanged: rows older than the window are still removed, and recent
  ones are still refused. The connection the application uses is the database owner in the shipped
  compose file, and an owner can still disable or drop a trigger; closing that needs a role with
  `INSERT` and `SELECT` only, which is a separate change. Reported by @beardthelion, who also named
  the failure mode of the obvious fix and saved it from shipping as one.
- **A declined take-the-wheel destroyed the conversation.** A Bot that asks for help with a sign-in
  and never gets it left an assistant message holding a tool call that nothing ever answered, and
  every later turn in that thread failed at the provider. Declining once meant nothing you typed
  afterwards got an answer, with no way back but a new chat. Unanswered calls are now answered when
  the history is rebuilt, with the truth rather than a fake success: no result came, the run has
  ended, carry on without it and say what could not be done.
- **The audit trail could not say why a conversation went where it did.** It recorded the router's
  choice and recorded nothing at all when a person named a coworker with `@`, which is
  indistinguishable from a row that failed to write. A mention is now recorded too, as the person's
  own choice, without asking the model a question they had already answered. The audit page names the
  coworker and separates the three cases: chosen by the person, matched by the router, or the default
  because nothing matched.
- **A Bot with half a connector sent people to a sign-in box.** Granted a vendor's search but not its
  read, it found the document, could not read it, and opened the vendor's website to try, where it
  met a sign-in wall and asked the person to take the wheel. They already had access; the missing
  thing was the Bot's grant, and nothing said so. A gap in what a Bot holds is now reported as a gap:
  it names the capability it would need and says an administrator can grant it on that connector.
- **Answers arrived with no sign of where they came from.** Asked a compliance question, a Bot
  replied with a filing obligation, a dollar threshold, a deadline and a retention period, and the
  audit trail for that turn held one row: the routing decision. A confident unsourced answer is
  indistinguishable from a confident wrong one. Every Bot is now told to cite what it read and to say
  plainly when an answer is from its own knowledge instead. It is told this by the deployment rather
  than per agent, so it cannot be missing from the next Bot somebody adds, and it is explicitly not
  an instruction to go hunting for a source.
- **A Bot browsed to a vendor it already had tools for.** Granted Google Drive, asked what was in a
  document, it opened `drive.google.com` in its own browser, met a sign-in page that browser can
  never satisfy, and asked the person to sign in to an account they had already connected. A tool
  array says a tool exists; it does not say the tool is the way to reach that system, and it was
  competing with a page of prose about the browser that mentions connectors nowhere. A Bot is now
  told which systems it holds tools for, generated from its grants and placed before that prose, so
  enabling a connector changes what the Bot is told on its next run.
- **A question went to a coworker that had no way to answer it.** Routing read the sentence somebody
  wrote about what a coworker is for, which is not the same as what it can reach, so a question about
  a Drive document went to the one whose description says "company knowledge" and which held no Drive
  grants. Candidates now carry the systems they hold tools for. Purpose still decides first: a
  specialist with no connectors is still right for a question about its specialism.
- **A deny rule about submitting a form was walked around by typing.** `computer_type` takes a
  `submit` flag that presses Enter once the text is in, and the policy never saw a key, so a rule
  refused at the button and at the keypress let the third route through. Both shipped copies of that
  rule name both tools now, the key reaches the policy, and the audit row carries it — without it a
  row said a field was filled in rather than that a form was sent.
- **A Bot refused at the door left no trace.** A callback that could not prove which Bot it was
  returned 401 and wrote nothing, so a Bot holding a token the deployment no longer accepted had
  every call refused, returned nothing to its own model, and the model told the person there were no
  results. A false negative delivered as an answer, with the audit trail agreeing nothing had
  happened. Recorded now as `mcp.callback_refused`, naming the tool and the reason but no Bot or
  actor, since both arrive in the credential that just failed to verify.
- **An unanswered request for the wheel followed a Bot around.** Control belongs to a Bot's computer
  rather than to a conversation, so a request nobody took sat there indefinitely and every later
  conversation with that Bot showed a live prompt for work it was not doing, captioned with a reason
  written for somebody else. An unanswered ask now stops being shown after ten minutes and its reason
  goes with it. A person actually holding the wheel is never timed out.
- **`/admin/computers` listed nothing, ever.** Admin addressed the fleet through a per-Bot route with
  a placeholder id, which stopped working when that route began checking whether the caller may act
  as the Bot in the path. The screen renders nothing while the list is null, so a deployment with two
  running computers looked like one with none. The fleet has a route of its own, still
  administrator-only.
- **Every shipped component was recorded twice on a first start.** Two browsers announcing at once is
  ordinary and the insert was already safe for it; the answer was not, so the loser of that race
  named every component anyway and the caller wrote an audit row per name.
- **A Bot could reach the deployment's own network by writing the address a different way.** The
  guard refused `169.254.169.254` and the private ranges as usually written, but not the same
  addresses spelled as an IPv6-mapped or NAT64 form, an integer, or with a trailing dot, so a Bot
  talked into fetching one still reached cloud metadata or an internal host. The address is
  canonicalised before it is checked now, the mapped form of `0.0.0.0` (which reaches every local
  port) is refused, and the container credential endpoints a hosted deployment must never expose —
  ECS and Fargate's `169.254.170.2`, Alibaba's `100.100.100.200` — are refused even when the
  private-host opt-in is on. The same guard backs agent registration, so it is closed there too.
- **The supervisor could adopt a container it did not create.** When starting a Bot's computer hit a
  name already taken, it started whatever held the name and handed it the deployment's computer
  token, so on a Docker host shared with anything else it could drive a stranger's container as a
  Bot's. It now refuses a container that does not carry its own namespace label, read from the
  container rather than inferred, so a second deployment on the same host is never adopted.
- **Removing somebody left the credentials they had granted this deployment sitting in the vault.**
  Removing them from the People screen ended their sessions and stopped the next sign-in, and left the
  refresh token behind, unrevoked. They could not use it — the account comes from a session they no
  longer get — but "we removed their access" was not true of the token, which for a connector read as
  the person asking is the part that matters. Removing somebody now retires it, and each retirement is
  on the audit trail as `mcp.account_disconnected`. Deleting a person's row used to be worse, because
  it took the connection record with it and left the credential reachable by nothing at all; those are
  found and retired too. This stops the deployment holding a usable secret. It does **not** withdraw
  the grant at the vendor, which needs revoking there until disconnect ships, and the audit row says
  which of the two happened rather than implying both.
- **The one-container image registered a coworker it could not run.** `MANAGED_AGENT_AG_UI_URL`
  defaulted to `localhost:4201` and was required, so Risk Analyst appeared on the roster and every
  conversation with it failed. The URL is optional; the package omits that coworker when it is
  unset. `scripts/start.sh` still points it at `agent-langgraph` on a laptop.
- **A boundary rule applied on one server out of N.** The policy is read from memory on every action,
  which is right, but memory was only ever filled at boot. An administrator's new deny rule was
  enforced by whichever process served the request and roughly one action in N went through it, while
  the admin screen reported success because the row really was saved and the audit trail agreed
  because it records the boundary each process started with. Both honest, and both describing
  something other than what the fleet was enforcing. A write now announces on Postgres in the same
  transaction and every server re-reads, including on reconnect, so a server that was down when the
  rule changed catches up rather than waiting for a restart. Reset travels the same way.
- **A ref resolved on one replica and nowhere else.** The gateway turns the opaque ref in a click into
  the element it points at, and that mapping lived in a `Map` in the process that took the snapshot.
  On any other replica the ref resolved to nothing, so a deny rule written about the element did not
  match and the click went through, recorded as allowed with no rule. It is in Postgres now, keyed on
  the generation the computer stamped, so a ref from a superseded page still resolves to nothing.
- **Anybody signed in could act as anybody's Bot.** The Bot id travels in the path and the acting
  routes checked only that somebody was signed in, so a signed-in person could drive another person's
  private Bot, reset its browser, read its screen and fire its granted tools. Every route under a Bot
  id now asks the store the same question the roster already asks, and a Bot that does not exist and
  one belonging to somebody else answer identically.
- **The computer fleet listing was open to any signed-in person.** It ignores its `:botId` and returns
  every Bot's machine, so it told anybody who could reach it every Bot id in the deployment and
  whether each was running, private coworkers included. Administrator-only now.
- **A Bot id could name a directory outside the profiles volume.** The id arrives as a URL segment or
  a header, was joined onto a filesystem path, and `reset` deletes that path recursively as root, so
  `../../tmp/something` deleted it. Refused at the request boundary and again where the path is built.
- **A mistyped deny rule permitted instead of refusing.** A rule that parsed and evaluated but
  answered with something other than true or false was neither a match nor an error, so
  `deny: ["Submit order"]` — what somebody writes who reads the list as labels — let the action
  through with nothing logged, while the rule sat on the Boundaries page looking as though it were in
  force. Any non-boolean answer is now a broken rule and takes the existing fail-closed path.
- **Rotating a Bot's key left the old one live.** Editing a key wrote a new vault row and repointed
  the Bot at it, leaving the previous credential decryptable and still valid with nothing listing it,
  so rotation did not do the one thing rotation is for. Deleting a Bot left its key live too. Both
  revoke now.
- **Nothing recorded what changed about a Bot.** Ten mutating routes wrote one audit row between them
  and there was no event type for any of the other nine. A Bot's endpoint is where conversation
  content is sent, so "who pointed this Bot at that host, and when" is the first question in an
  incident and could not be answered. Eight event types and eight rows now, recording what changed and
  never a value.
- **The people list and the channel list grew without bound.** Both were read in full on every render,
  and reading one person ran the whole people aggregate over the deployment twice per role change.
  Both are paged now, and the people screen searches on the server so somebody can be found without
  walking pages.
- **A computer accumulated one browser per Bot, forever.** `COMPUTER_MAX_BROWSERS` and
  `COMPUTER_BROWSER_IDLE_MS` set the two limits. Nothing closed an idle one, so a deployment
  where every employee has a Bot trends toward a resident Chromium per employee in one container until
  it is killed for memory. There is a cap and an idle timeout, and closing one costs only a relaunch
  because the profile is on disk.
- **The audit screen's filters were sequential scans.** It filters by event type, by who did it and by
  what it was done to, and the only index was on the timestamp, over what becomes the largest table in
  the deployment. Each filter leads its own index now.
- **A deployment with no identity provider came up open by default.** Covered under Changed above,
  and listed here too because it is the one on this list that was reachable from the internet.
- **Registering a company's identity provider was owned by whoever registered it.** Better Auth
  answers its own listing route with only the providers the person asking registered, and refuses a
  removal from anybody else, so a second administrator opened the Identity providers screen, found
  it empty, and registered one that already existed. Worse, the row cascaded from that person's user
  row: deleting the administrator who set sign-in up deleted the company's sign-in with them. What is
  registered is a fact about the deployment, so reads and removals go through OpenBot's own
  administrator-only routes against the whole table, and a provider outlives the person who added it.
- **A customer's client secret was in the clear.** The SSO plugin writes `oidc_config` and
  `saml_config` as plaintext JSON, with the OAuth client secret for that company's directory inside
  them: the one secret here not going through `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Both are now encrypted at rest.
  Rows written before this still read, and are re-encrypted the next time they are written. OAuth
  access and refresh tokens use Better Auth's own encryption, keyed on `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
- **A failed provider registration looked like a button that did not work.** The error was rendered
  on the page behind the dialog, which was covering it.
- **Deleting a component in the playground could release one the build ships.** `DELETE
  /api/sandboxed/:name` deleted from the shared components table by name, without checking
  which kind of component the name belonged to. Naming a compiled component removed its
  governance row, and the foreign keys took that component's per-Bot withholdings and its
  function grants with it. Withholding is the half that fails open: a published component is
  available to every Bot unless a row says otherwise, so the next catalogue announcement brought
  the component back published, and available to a Bot it had deliberately been kept from. The
  audit row called it `kind: "sandboxed"`. The endpoint now refuses a name this surface does not
  own and answers 404, the way publishing already did. A governance row whose source is already
  gone is still this surface's to clear.
- **A write could follow a symlink out of the Bot's workspace.** The confinement resolved the
  directory a write would land in but not the name it would land on, so a link left at `notes.txt`
  pointing outside was followed by the write; a read through the identical link was already refused.
  The gateway had already decided and written the audit row against the path as it was asked for, so a
  rule written for `credentials/` never saw the file that was written and the trail named a file
  nothing had touched. A dangling link escaped the same way, because resolving the path throws where
  the write would still land. Links pointing back inside the workspace continue to work.
- **A Bot could become root inside its container.** `sudo` was granted as `NOPASSWD: ALL`, and the
  comment above it named the two conditions that made that acceptable: the container being one Bot's
  alone, and not holding a database. The image meets neither, because the supervisor is deliberately
  not in it and `EMBEDDED_POSTGRES=on` is a documented way to run it. So root read another Bot's
  workspace, the API's environment, and the audit database recording what it did. The grant now names
  the package managers, so `apt-get install` still works and `sudo cat /proc/1/environ` does not. It
  is a floor rather than a boundary: code a model wrote needs a computer per Bot with
  `COMPUTER_SUPERVISOR_URL` and a sandbox under it with `COMPUTER_RUNTIME=runsc`, both of which this
  already supports and neither of which the single-container image can reach.
- **A command could take the computer down, or outlive being stopped.** Output was accumulated in
  full and only trimmed at the end, so `cat` of a large file allocated until the process that owns
  the browser died; it is now bounded as it arrives, and still reports that it was truncated rather
  than quietly ending. A stop signalled bash alone, so `sleep 30 | cat` left its children holding the
  pipes and the call never returned; the whole process group is signalled now. A `timeoutMs` of zero
  or less killed the command before it started and called it a timeout; it has a floor as well as a
  ceiling.
- **Stop did not reach a running command.** The `/exec` route never took the person's abort, so the
  plumbing for it was dead code and a stopped run left the command finishing inside the container.
- **The live-screen socket did not check the address it was given.** Every acting path resolved
  through the gateway, which refuses a foreign or cloud-metadata address; this one asked the provider
  directly and then put `COMPUTER_TOKEN` in the query string of whatever it was told.
- **`COMPUTER_SHELL_ENV` refuses the names that run before a command.** Naming `GITHUB_TOKEN` is an
  operator deciding a Bot may use a token. Naming `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` or the shell option
  variables is handing a Bot a hook into every later command, which is unlikely to be what was meant,
  so those are refused and said out loud rather than passed. A name that is not a variable name is
  now reported too, instead of quietly disappearing.
- **A deny rule naming one field refused every action that did not have it.** `deny:
  contains(command, "rm -rf")`, the example the documentation gives, refused every click, keypress,
  navigation and file read in the deployment. Two correct behaviours combined into a wrong one: the
  policy context left out fields an action did not have, cel-js treats a missing field as an unknown
  identifier and throws, and a thrown deny counts as a match so that a mistyped deny refuses rather
  than quietly permitting. Every field is now bound, with a neutral value where the action has
  nothing to put there, so a rule about a shell answers honestly about a click instead of refusing
  it. Rules about the action they are for are unchanged. The audit row still omits what did not
  happen.
- **A command longer than 45 seconds reported failure while it carried on running.** The transport
  gave every call the same deadline, which was shorter than the shell's own 120 second default and
  600 second maximum, so `apt-get install` told the person the computer had not responded and then
  finished installing inside the container. A command now gets a deadline that outlasts the shell,
  which reports a timeout itself and says so.

- **A Bot's shell no longer inherits the deployment's environment.** Commands ran with the computer
  process's own environment, so `env` in the one-container image printed `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and
  the rest of `.env`. The shell now receives PATH, locale and terminal names, and the proxy
  variables. Userinfo is stripped from a proxy URL, so a password in `HTTP_PROXY` is not in `env`.
  Anything else is named in `COMPUTER_SHELL_ENV`.
- **A deployment served over plain HTTP could not start a conversation.** The chat surface minted
  identifiers with `crypto.randomUUID`, which browsers withhold outside a secure context. On a
  laptop `http://localhost` counts as one, so this never showed up in development; on a real
  address it does not, and the surface did nothing at all when you pressed send. No message, no
  error. Ids now come from an API with no such restriction.
- **A Bot asked to be signed in, in words, and nothing happened.** Handing over the browser is a tool
  call, and a sentence in the transcript is not one: "please sign in and let me know" leaves the
  person with no wheel to take and the page where it was. Bots wrote that sentence anyway, and one
  went further and asked for a username and password to be typed into a sign-in page nobody could
  reach. The guidance now says that calling `computer_request_help` is what asking means, names the
  sentences that are not it, and says the person cannot see the page at all until control is handed
  over. Asked to file an issue on a site it was not signed in to, a Bot now offers the wheel on the
  first attempt instead of the third.
- **A package Bot did not know it had a computer.** The instructions that make the computer usable —
  snapshot before acting, and ask a person to take the wheel at a sign-in rather than reporting the
  task as impossible — were imported by the two shipped Bots and by nothing else, so a built-in agent
  knew only the role its package gave it. The tools were on offer to it the whole time. Asked to file
  an issue on a site it was not signed in to, it browsed to the page, said it could not, and never
  called `computer_request_help`, so nobody was ever offered the wheel. Built-in agents are now told
  the same thing the shipped Bots are told, wherever a computer is configured.
- **A chat could quietly forget everything and carry on.** The browser remembers a thread id for each
  Bot, and nothing ever asked whether Intelligence still had that thread. Where it did not, the
  transcript loaded empty, every later message silently recreated an empty thread under the same id,
  and the Bot answered as though the conversation were new — with the reason nowhere but the server
  log, as a 404 flattened into a 500 by the time it reached the browser. A remembered thread is now
  checked before it is used: one the platform provably does not have is replaced, because there is no
  conversation left to lose, and a check that fails for any other reason keeps the thread and says on
  screen that earlier messages could not be loaded. A person reading a confident answer can now tell
  whether the Bot has read what came before it.
- **The first browser action a Bot was ever asked for failed.** Creating a computer and starting it
  are two calls to Docker, and a name the daemon has not published yet answers the second with a 404.
  The supervisor treats that as a lost race and rebuilds, which is right, but it went straight back
  round: the retry landed a millisecond later, saw the same unpublished name, and spent the only
  other attempt on it. The whole request then failed as Docker being unreachable, the person was told
  the computer could not be started, and the next message worked. It waits one poll interval before
  rebuilding now, which is what the health wait already uses for the same question.
- **A framework Bot asked for a browser action and nothing happened.** `agent-langgraph` ends a run
  when the model calls a tool the surface owns, which is how a tool that lives in the browser is
  supposed to work: the run finishes, the surface acts, and the next run carries the result. But the
  call was only reported to the surface from the node that executes this deployment's own tools, and
  that node is exactly what an ending run skips. The person saw their own message, no answer under
  it, and no explanation, because a run that finishes carrying nothing is not an error. Every Bot
  action in the browser was affected: opening a page, filling a form, asking for help at a sign-in.

### Changed

- **A retention policy for the audit trail.** `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` removes rows older than the
  window it names, swept hourly by whichever server holds an advisory lock. Unset by default, because
  deleting somebody's audit trail because a default said so is the worse of the two failures. The
  trail stays append-only: the database permits a delete only when the transaction declares a
  retention window and only for rows already outside it, so removing recent rows is still impossible
  and an `UPDATE` still is under every condition.
- **`allowed_groups` is documented as a declaration, not a control.** The tenant package writes it and
  nothing reads it on any access path, and `users.groups` is written by nothing either, so both halves
  of the rule are waiting on group membership arriving from the identity provider. Channel access is
  membership alone. The columns stay, because they are the right shape for the rule they are named
  for. Thanks to [@NathanTarbert](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenBot/pull/92) and
  [@andreolf](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenBot/issues/82).
- **Running with no sign-in takes a flag and nothing else.** It used to be locked with
  `NODE_ENV=production`, which is exactly backwards: `NODE_ENV` is unset unless somebody sets it, so
  a container on a VM with a hand-written env file and no identity provider served every visitor on
  the internet as an administrator, silently, because nothing looked wrong from the outside. A
  deployment with no provider now refuses to start unless `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true` says it was
  meant. `.env.example` ships that line switched on, so a clone still runs with no configuration at
  all, and the line is greppable in a way a default never was. `OPENBOT_DEV_NO_AUTH` is still
  honoured.
- **Requires Better Auth 1.7**, which adds an `issuer` to every account. Migrations `0002` and `0003`
  add the column and backfill existing rows with their provider's real issuer, so nobody is asked to
  sign in again. The column stays nullable on purpose: a rolling deploy runs migrations and then
  serves from old and new replicas at once, and an old replica writes an account without it, so
  making it required in the same release would break the first sign-in of everybody who landed on a
  replica that had not been replaced yet. The constraint belongs to a later release.
- **Where a Bot's computer runs is now a plug.** One `ComputerProvider` interface sits under the
  gateway, with the Docker supervisor as one implementation and a shared computer as another. A
  computer somewhere else is an adapter rather than a change to the governed path. Thanks to
  [@mu-hashmi](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenBot/pull/57) for the refactor.
- The address a provider hands back is checked before anything is sent to it, and the cloud metadata
  addresses are refused whatever a provider says.
- The container image runs as an unprivileged user rather than root.
