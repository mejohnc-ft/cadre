# never compares its configuration and never recreates it.

# Which is how a Bot ends up holding a secret this deployment no longer accepts. `AGENT_TOOL_TOKEN`
# is generated above and written to .env; if the container was answering, it kept the previous one,
# and every tool call it made was refused at the door. It returns nothing to its own model, and the
# model tells the person there were no results — a false negative delivered as an answer.
#
# `docker compose up -d` is declarative and does nothing for a service whose configuration has not
# changed, so naming them all costs a comparison and buys the guarantee that what is running is what

  - Audit trail:           http://localhost:$APP_PORT/admin/audit
  - Boundaries/policy:     http://localhost:$APP_PORT/admin/boundaries
  - Setup docs:            README.md
  - Configuration docs:    docs/configuration.md

Try:

  1. Open /bot and ask: Open news.ycombinator.com and tell me the top story.
  2. Create a coworker in /agents and start a channel with it.
  3. Review browser/file actions in /admin/audit.
  4. Add a deny rule in /admin/boundaries, then retry the same action.

Stop Docker services: docker compose down
  A Bot's computer is made by the supervisor rather than by compose, so it keeps running:
  docker rm -f \$(docker ps -q --filter label=openbot.supervisor=true)
  Its files and its browser profile are volumes and survive either way.
Stop host app/server: kill the processes using ports $APP_PORT and $SERVER_PORT
